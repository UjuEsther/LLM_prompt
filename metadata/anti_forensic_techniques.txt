You are tasked with extracting and categorizing all anti-forensic techniques and tools explicitly discussed in the provided digital forensic paper.

Guidelines:
**STRICTLY FOLLOW ALL GUIDELINES**

t1. Definition of Anti-Forensics:
    - Anti-forensics refers to any method, action, or tool that is intentionally used to obscure, manipulate, destroy, or prevent access to digital evidence during forensic analysis.

t2. Use the Conlan et al. (2016) taxonomy to classify each anti-forensic technique. The categories are:

    - **Data Hiding**: Techniques that conceal the existence of data or evidence. 
        Examples: encryption, steganography, tunneling and so on.

    - **Artifact Wiping**: Techniques that deliberately remove traces or residual data from a system. 
        Examples: secure deletion, wiping logs, and registry cleaners.

    - **Trail Obfuscation**: Techniques that manipulate or falsify traces to confuse forensic analysis. 
        Examples: spoofing, timestamp manipulation, and synthetic log generation.

    - **Attacks Against Forensic Tools and Processes**: Methods that directly target forensic software or analysis workflows to evade or disrupt detection. 
        Examples: crashing forensic tools, disabling monitoring agents, or anti-debugging methods.

    - **Possible Indications of Anti-Forensic Activity**: Observable signs that suggest anti-forensics is in use, even if the specific technique is unknown. 
        Examples: the presence of encrypted virtual machines, unrecognized file structures, or anti-forensics apps.

t3. Make sure to include only techniques that are explicitly described in the paper.
    - Do not infer a technique if it is only referenced or assumed.

t4. If a technique does not match any of the five Conlan categories:
    - Check if the paper defines a new category. If so, label it as:
        "New Category: [Category Name] (Short explanation)"
    - If no new category is defined but the technique is still valid, label it as:
        "Other (Brief reason why it doesn’t match existing taxonomy)"

t5. Identify all named anti-forensics tools, software, or apps explicitly mentioned in the paper.
    - Only include tools if they are clearly linked to anti-forensic functions.

t6. For each technique, determine whether the paper explicitly states that it was developed or used specifically for mobile devices.
    - Mark it as "Yes" if the paper clearly states the method is designed for smartphones, Android, iOS, tablets, smartwatches, or similar.
    - Mark it as "No" if the paper presents it as a general anti-forensics technique without reference to mobile use.
    - Mark it as "Unclear" if the paper does not mention the intended platform at all.

Do not infer. Only mark "Yes" if the mobile context is explicitly stated in the paper.


t7. Real Example:
    If the paper mentions:
        - “Secure deletion” → classify it as: Artifact Wiping
        - “VPN tunneling” → classify it as: Data Hiding
        - “Program packers” → classify it as: Attacks Against Forensic Tools and Processes
        - “StegHide” → include under tools

Example JSON output:
{
  "techniques_mentioned": [
    "Secure deletion",
    "Text steganography",
    "Data poisoning"
  ],
  "technique_categories": {
    "Secure deletion": "Artifact Wiping",
    "Text steganography": "Data Hiding",
    "Data poisoning": "New Category: Training Data Manipulation (The paper defines this as injecting adversarial data into ML training sets to prevent forensic detection)"
  },
  "tools_mentioned": [
    "Eraser",
    "StegHide"
  ]
}

t7. Do not guess or assume the presence of techniques or tools. Only include entries that are directly and clearly stated in the paper.

Output Format:

Your response must be a valid JSON structure in the following format:

{
  "techniques_mentioned": ["List of anti-forensic techniques"],
  "technique_categories": {
    "Technique 1": "Category",

  },
  "tools_mentioned": ["List of tools"]
  "mobile_specificity": {
  "Technique": "Yes / No / Unclear"
}

}

Do not include any explanations or commentary. Return only the structured JSON output.
