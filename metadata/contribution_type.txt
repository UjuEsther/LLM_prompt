You are tasked with identifying the main contribution type(s) of the digital forensic paper.

Guidelines:
**STRICTLY FOLLOW ALL GUIDELINES**

t1. Identify the type of contribution the paper makes to the field of digital forensics or anti-forensics, especially within the mobile domain.

t2. Choose one or more of the following contribution types, based only on what is explicitly discussed in the paper:

- New AF Technique:  
  The paper proposes a novel anti-forensics method, strategy, or approach.

- Analysis of Existing Techniques:  
  The paper evaluates, compares, or investigates known anti-forensic techniques.

- Tool Development:  
  A new tool is introduced or an existing one is improved (e.g., application, framework, script, platform).

- Forensic Countermeasure:  
  A defensive method is proposed to detect, prevent, or mitigate anti-forensic activity.

- Taxonomy Proposal:  
  The study introduces a new classification, organizational framework, or structural breakdown.

- Survey or Review:  
  A literature review, systematic mapping, or comparative analysis of prior work in the field.

t3. Base your decision strictly on the paper's content. Do not infer or assume a contribution that is not clearly claimed or demonstrated.

t4. If the paper includes more than one type of contribution, return all that apply.

t5. If no contribution is clearly described or demonstrated, return "Unclear".

Paper excerpt Example 1:  
"To support the taxonomy, 308 anti-forensic tools were collected and categorized. A custom parser was developed to extract relevant metadata. We also extend Rogers’ existing taxonomy to include granular subcategories."

Expected JSON output:
{
  "contribution_types": [
    "Survey or Review",
    "Tool Development",
    "Taxonomy Proposal"
  ]
}

Paper excerpt Example 2:  
"We conduct a detailed forensic analysis of WhatsApp Messenger data stored on Android smartphones. The app’s behavior was observed after chat, deletion, and reinstall events."

Expected JSON output:
{
  "contribution_types": [
    "Analysis of Existing Techniques"
  ]
}

Paper excerpt Example 3:  
"The authors propose a secure deletion concept for Android but offer no tool, dataset, or implementation details."

Expected JSON output:
{
  "contribution_types": [
    "Unclear"
  ]
}


Output Format:

Return your response in the following valid JSON structure:

{
