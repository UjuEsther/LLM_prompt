You are tasked with identifying all operating system platforms and digital devices explicitly discussed in the digital forensic paper.

Guidelines:
**STRICTLY FOLLOW ALL GUIDELINES**

t1. Definition of a Platform:
    - A platform refers to an operating system or software environment under which digital devices function.
    - Examples of platforms include: Android, iOS, Windows, Linux, macOS, HarmonyOS, Symbian, KaiOS, and embedded operating systems for IoT devices.

t2. Definition of a Device:
    - A device refers to a physical digital system or hardware component discussed in the paper.
    - Example include: smartphones, tablets, smartwatches, PDAs, USB drives, IoT devices, laptops, desktops, external hard drives, and servers.
    - Each device should be listed exactly as described in the paper. Do not summarize or generalize.

t3. Definition of Mobile Devices:
    - A mobile device is a small-scale, portable, and network-capable digital system designed for personal use and mobility.
    - Examples of mobile devices include:
        - Smartphones
        - Tablets
        - Smartwatches and wearables
        - Portable IoT devices
        - PDAs

t4. Be Comprehensive & Systematic:
    - Carefully review the entire paper for platform and device mentions.
    - Do not list partial references or paraphrased terms.


t5. Real Example from a Paper:
Consider the paper *"Forensic Investigation of Android Smartwatch Devices"*:

- The paper explicitly mentions the following platforms and devices:
  - Platforms: Android, WearOS
  - Devices: Smartwatch, Smartphone, USB Drive
- Based on the definition above, the mobile devices are:
  - Smartwatch, Smartphone

Your output in this case would be:
{
  "platforms_discussed": ["Android", "WearOS"],
  "device_types_covered": ["Smartwatch", "Smartphone", "USB Drive"],
  "mobile_devices_identified": ["Smartwatch", "Smartphone"]
}

t6. No Guessing or Inference:
- Do not guess or infer platforms or devices that are not explicitly named.
- If the paper does not mention any platform or device, return all fields as empty lists:

{
  "platforms_discussed": [],
  "device_types_covered": [],
  "mobile_devices_identified": []
}

Output Format:

Your response must be a valid JSON structure in the following format:

{
  "platforms_discussed": ["List of platforms"],
  "device_types_covered": ["List of device types"],
  "mobile_devices_identified": ["Subset of device types classified as mobile"]
}

Do not include any additional explanations or commentary. Return only the structured JSON output.
