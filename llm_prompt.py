==============================
üìò DEFINITION: FORENSIC ARTIFACTS
==============================
Forensic artifacts are residual data or metadata unintentionally left behind on a system, especially after anti-forensic tools have attempted to hide or erase them.

- Log entries showing past app use or system events
- Media previews stored in thumbnails
- SQLite databases used by mobile apps
- Temp files, crash logs, or remnants in unallocated space

==============================
üìå CATEGORIZATION DIMENSIONS
==============================
If artifacts are found, categorize them under one or more of the following axes:

1. **Storage Location**:
   - Internal memory
   - External/SD card
   - App-specific directories
   - Cache folders
   - Unallocated space
   - Cloud-synced remnants

2. **Artifact Format / Type**:
   - Cache data
   - Deleted documents
   - SQLite databases
   - Media previews (.JPG, .MOV, .THM)
   - Log files
   - Temp files or configuration traces

3. **System Layer**:
   - Application Layer
   - Operating System Layer
   - Volatile Memory (RAM)
   - File System Layer
